# Easy-Manuscript-Preparation-with-LaTeX
LaTeX (pronounced as ‘Lah-teck’) is a free-to-use, document-preparation platform that has many advantages over usual word processors, such as MS-Word. It allows authors to focus on the content, without worrying about formatting issues (figures &amp; tables jumping around) or mixing-up citations. LaTeX has easy bibliography management, figure organization, and beautiful calligraphic properties. LaTeX is a go-to writing platform for professional scientists. This hands-on workshop, helps you to learn how to:  use a template to produce professional looking content &amp; eliminate formatting issues; use LaTeX templates provided by journals to produce manuscripts that automatically comply with their guidelines; use the online platform "Overleaf" [Yale University has professional subscription: https://www.overleaf.com/edu/yale] to produce documents on LaTeX.
